# The Facade Pattern

> The **Facade Pattern** is a variant of **Structural Design Pattern**

## Understanding Structural design patterns

The following points will help us understand more about Structural patterns:

* Structural patterns describe how objects and classes can be combined to form larger structures.
* Structural patterns can be thought of as design patterns that ease the design by identifying simpler ways to realize or demonstrate relationships between entities. Entities mean objects or classes in the object-oriented world.
* While the Class patterns describe abstraction with the help of inheritance and provide a more useful program interface, Object patterns describe how objects can be associated and composed to form larger objects. Structural patterns are a combination of Class and Object patterns.

**Some of the examples of Structural design patterns are as follows:**

* **Adapter pattern**: Adapting an interface to another one so that it meets the client’s expectations. It tries to match interfaces of different classes based on the client’s needs.

* **Bridge pattern**: This decouples an object’s interface from its implementation so that both can work independently.

* **Decorator pattern**: This defines additional responsibilities for an object at runtime or dynamically. We add certain attributes to objects with an interface.
