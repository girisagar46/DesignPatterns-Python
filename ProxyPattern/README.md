# Proxy Design Pattern

* Proxy  is a class that acts as an interface to real objects. Objects can be of several types such as network connections, large objects in memory and file, among others. 

* Proxy  is a wrapper or agent object that wraps the real serving object. Proxy could provide additional functionality to the object that it wraps and doesn’t change the object’s code. 

* The main intention of the Proxy pattern is to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object in order to control access to a real object.
